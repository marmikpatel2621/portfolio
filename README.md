# Portfolio Redesign (Static Export)

This is a modern, minimal portfolio layout designed for a senior solutions architect / senior data engineer profile.

## Key points
- Clean, executive aesthetic (neutral palette, strong typography, consistent spacing).
- Architecture-first structure: Projects → Skills → Experience.
- Content is sourced from your knowledge base markdown (no new roles invented).

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build static site
```bash
npm run build
```
Outputs to `out/` (Next.js static export).
